                Nowadays, people pay more attention to their outfits of the day(OOTD) and outfit matching.
                However, despite the considerable time they spent, still, the final illustration may not be good
                as people expected, thus comes the problem of dressing difficulties for people’s daily needs.
                Based on the existing cloth matching platform, one problem worth noticing is that most of them didn’t take the occasions
                and weather into consideration, rather simplifying classify the categories based on the cloth types.
                In this way, it can’t really resolve the user’s demand when there is a special event to attend or encounter harsh weather.
                Also, we found almost all the existing attempt have their own shopping function while some users might not trust the source and quality of the outfit bought through their outfit platform.
                In addition, the existing attempts take a lot of steps before recommending the outfits are user-unfriendly.
                In general, by this chance, the site Dvougue is an outfit planner platform for users to fulfill their different needs of daily dressing,
                by incorporating the condition that other websites didn’t include.
