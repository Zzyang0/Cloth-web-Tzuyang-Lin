        <p>Nowadays, people pay more attention to their outfits of the day(OOTD) and outfit matching. 
        However, despite the considerable time they spent, still, the final illustration may not be 
        good as people expected, thus comes the problem of dressing difficulties for people's daily needs. 
        There are some websites that address with helping and recommending outfits for people. For example, 
        the website called  <a href=" https://dresoo.com/">Dresso</a> helps people find, mix and match randomly of 
        the whole outfit until they find the one they like. Dreeso's outfits can be directly purchased from 
        their website and all the clothes are the web's own brand. There are other existing attempts 
        like <a href="https://www.stitchfix.com/">“Stitch”</a> which people take a style quiz and stitch's stylists 
        will give tips for outfits based on the user's budget and style. The website is collaborating with 
        hundreds of brands like Nike, the Northface…and people can shop for different brands on this website. 
        Based on the existing cloth matching platform, one problem worth noticing is that most of them didn't 
        take the occasions and weather into consideration, rather simplifying classify the categories based on 
        the cloth types. In this way, it can't really resolve the user's demand when there is a special event to 
        attend or encounter harsh weather. Also, we found almost all the existing attempt have their own shopping 
        function while some users might not trust the source and quality of the outfit bought through their outfit 
        platform. In addition, the existing attempts take a lot of steps before recommending the outfits are 
        user-unfriendly. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In general, by this chance, we aim to construct an outfit planner platform for users to fulfill their 
            different needs of daily dressing, by incorporating the condition that other websites didn't include.
