       <section class="Problem-section">
        <p>Nowadays, people pay more attention to their outfits of the day(OOTD) and outfit matching.
        However, despite the considerable time they spent, still, the final illustration may not be
        good as people expected, thus comes the problem of dressing difficulties for people's daily needs.
        There are some websites that address with helping and recommending outfits for people. For example,
        the website called  <a href=" https://dresoo.com/">Dresso</a> helps people find, mix and match randomly of
        the whole outfit until they find the one they like. Dreeso's outfits can be directly purchased from
        their website and all the clothes are the web's own brand. There are other existing attempts
        like <a href="https://www.stitchfix.com/">“Stitch”</a> which people take a style quiz and stitch's stylists
        will give tips for outfits based on the user's budget and style. The website is collaborating with
        hundreds of brands like Nike, the Northface…and people can shop for different brands on this website.
        Based on the existing cloth matching platform, one problem worth noticing is that most of them didn't
        take the occasions and weather into consideration, rather simplifying classify the categories based on
        the cloth types. In this way, it can't really resolve the user's demand when there is a special event to
        attend or encounter harsh weather. Also, we found almost all the existing attempt have their own shopping
        function while some users might not trust the source and quality of the outfit bought through their outfit
        platform. In addition, the existing attempts take a lot of steps before recommending the outfits are
        user-unfriendly.
        </p>
        <p>
            In general, by this chance, we aim to construct an outfit planner platform for users to fulfill their
            different needs of daily dressing, by incorporating the condition that other websites didn't include.
